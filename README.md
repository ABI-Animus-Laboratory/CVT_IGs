# Interactive Flatmaps of Mechanisms to Modulate Cerebrovascular Tone
## Repository Role
The role of this repo is to centralise and coordinate community development of an interative resource to store knowledge on mechanisms that modulate verebrovascular tone.

## Goal
Ideally, interaction is like the figure below, where cursor probing will share information for researchers to use for learning, study design and result interpretation. This is based on the development of flatmap libraries hosted by [sparc](sparc.science). An example flatmap is shown [here](https://sparc.science/maps?type=ac).

## Registering Interest
Please reach out to Sergio Dempsey (sdem348@aucklanduni.ac.nz) to register interest in contributing to the work. Eventually, all will be named contributors for this repo and appropriately recognised. Lastly, feel free to post in the dicussion thread any advice or resources
